# Crowdium
This was made to allow community to translate any texts Sodium mod adds inside crowdin and in any language (just tell me if you want me to add one). You dont have to follow any glossary but it is recommended to do!

Simple community project not affiliated with Mojang AB., Minecraft nor Sodium or its developers as it is run by a member of the community.

# How to translate
You need to create an account on Crowdin, then you can translate in this link: https://crowdin.com/project/crowdium
just search up your language, pick it and pin the web

# How to download and use translations
Click on a green "code" button and click on "download zip". Open downloaded zip file, open the folder inside, extract folder inside this folder, open Minecraft, settings, resourcepacks and drag and drop the file you extracted to the Minecraft window.

# But it doesn't work! (or i can't make minecraft a window)
Inside Minecraft, you can click on a button "Resourcepack folder" and put the extracted file into the window which has just opened.

Don't forget to choose the resourcepack in the resourcepacks menu inside Minecraft!
